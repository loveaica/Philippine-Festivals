<h2 id="indent">The origin of most early festivals, locally known as <em><a href="https://www.tropicalexperiencephilippines.com/events-festival-philippines">"fiestas"</a></em>, are rooted in Christianity,
dating back to the <em><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines/The-Spanish-period"> Spanish colonial period </a></em> when the many communities <em>(such as barrios and towns)</em>
of the predominantly Catholic <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"> Philippines </a></em> almost always had a patron saint assigned to each of them.
Originally encouraged by the Spanish to coincide with Christian holy days, early patronal festivals
became vital instruments in spreading <em>Christianity throughout the country.</em>
Festivals in the Philippines can be <em>religious, cultural, or both.</em> Several of these are held to honor

on their faces. In the Philippines, festivals are classified into two types: <em>Religious and Nonreligious.</em>
Religious Festivals honor specific religious icons and commemorate significant occurrences and concepts
in a religion’s history and theology. Nonreligious Festivals are celebrated to give gratitude for a bountiful
harvest and the success of the people's industries.</h2><br>
<br>

      <h3 id="indent"><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinulog"> The Sinulog Festival </a></em> is a <em>religious festival</em> that is one of the Philippines’ <em>largest and most popular.</em> <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu_City">Cebu City</a></em> honors Santo Niño (Child Jesus) on the 3rd Sunday of January. The Sinulog Festival has a <em>grand parade, street parties, and religious processions.</em> Dancers dressed in <em>brightly colored costumes</em> perform to the rhythm of drums and trumpets, resulting in a spectacular show. The festival also entails a tidal parade, where the image of the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Ni%C3%B1o_de_Ceb%C3%BA">Santo Niño</a></em> is carried by boat along the <em>Mactan Channel. Novena masses, street parties, and live concerts are held before and after the main parade,</em> adding to the festive atmosphere. <br>
		<br>
		This festival is considered to be the largest in the country, attracting between 1 million and 1.5 million people each year. It's celebrated in honor of Santo Niño, or the Holy Child Jesus and is known for its vibrant street parties and grand parade. The festival's name, Sinulog, comes from the Cebuano word <em><a href="https://balambancebu.gov.ph/sinulog-comes-from-the-cebuano-word-sulog-which-means-like-water-current-movement/"> "sulog"</a></em>, which means "water current".The dance associated with the festival consists of two steps forward and one step backward, done to the sound of drums, which is said to resemble the movement of a <em>river's current.</em> <br>
		<br>
		The Sinulog Festival has a rich history dating back to the arrival of the Spanish in the Philippines. According to historical accounts, the original image of Santo Niño was a baptismal gift from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a></em> to <em><a href="https://sinaunangpanahon.com/who-is-rajah-humabon-of-cebu/#:~:text=Queen%20Juana%2C%20the%20wife%20of,endorsement%20of%20the%20new%20religion.">Queen Juana</a></em> of Cebu in 1521. This marked the beginning of Christianity in the Philippines. The festival today commemorates the Filipino people's acceptance of <em>Christianity.</em> The festival includes various activities such as a grand parade with <em>vibrant costumes and festive music, a grand firework display, and sampling of local food.</em> The phrase <em><a href="https://santoninodecebubasilica.org/chronicles/viva-pit-senor-viva-senor-santo-nino/">"Viva Pit Senyor!"</a></em> is commonly heard during the festival, which translates to <em>"Hail Lord, listen to our prayers!"</em> Despite the ongoing pandemic, the Sinulog Festival continues to be celebrated with adjustments for safety protocols,
		including virtual mass.</li></h3><br>
		
<br>
<h1><em> Sinulog Dance Steps </em></h1>
<h3 id="indent">The Sinulog dance steps are also believed to originate from <em><a href="https://sinaunangpanahon.com/baladhay-the-trusted-adviser-of-rajah-humabon/">Baladhay,</a></em> Rajah Humabon's adviser.<br>
When Baladhay got sick, Humabon ordered his tribe to bring Baladhay into a room where the
Santo Niño was enthroned. After a few days, Baladhay was heard shouting and was found dancing
by the native tribe. Baladhay was asked as to why was he was shouting and dancing. He pointed
at the image of the <em>holy Jesus</em> and explained that baby Jesus was tickling him.<br>
<br>
In turn, Baladhay danced with the little child and explained that he was </em>dancing the movements
of the river.</em> To this day, the two-steps forward, the one-step backward movement is still used
by Santo Niño devotees who believe that it was the Santo Niño's choice to have <em>Baladhay dance.</em></h3><br>

     <h3 id="indent"><em><a href="https://www.wanderlust.co.uk/content/pahiyas-philippines-festival/"> The Pahiyas Festival,</a></em> held in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucban"> Lucban, Quezon, Philippines,</a></em> is a vibrant celebration of <em>faith and harvest.</em> <em>To honor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_the_Laborer"> San Isidro Labrador,</a> the patron saint of farmers,</em> an annual celebration is held on May 15. The elaborate and vibrant garlands which cover the town’s houses at the festival are well-known.<br>
	 <br>
	 The houses are covered with <em>vibrant displays</em> made from <em>rice wafers, or “kiping,” fruits, vegetables, and other
	  agricultural products</em> during the Pahiyas Festival. These decorations serve as an act of <em>thanking the harvest and featuring its abundance.</em>

	  well as tourists are drawn to it as they want to take in the vibrant and joyous mood of this special occasion.<br>
	  <br>
	  Pahiyas came from two terms in the Philippines: <em>‘hiyas,’</em> which is a rare stone, and <em>‘payas,’</em> which means to decorate anything for an offering.
	  The Pahiyas celebration translates to <em>“presenting the most valuable pearls of the abundant crop”.</em> The Pahiyas Festival began as a gift-giving rite by
	  the people of Lucban to the <em><a href="https://franciscanmissionaries.com/"> Franciscan missionaries</a></em> who brought Catholicism to Quezon in 1583. The town’s first church administrator,<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Plasencia"> Juan de Placencia </a></em>
	  continued the practice of donating the crop to the Spanish friars. He did this as a sign of thanks for a fruitful harvest. 
	The next parish priest, <em><a href="https://ofmphilarchives.tripod.com/id9.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20born%20in%20the,day%20of%20July%20of%201578.">Diego de Oropesa</a></em>, continued the rite until it became a Lucban regular.</li></h3> <br>

<h1><strong><em> What is the history of Ati-Atihan?</em></strong></h1>
<h3 id="indent">Ati-Atihan originated in the 13th century as a <em><a href="https://homework.study.com/explanation/what-are-pagan-festivals.html#:~:text=Pagan%20festivals%20are%20celebrations%20of,the%20Roman%20Saturnalia%20and%20Neptunalia."> pagan festival.</a></em> It began as a celebration of peace between the Aetas (indigenous people) of Panay Island
and the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"> Malaysia </a></em> from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo"> Borneo</a></em> who arrived at the island seeking a new place to live.</h3><br>

<h1><strong><em>There are two different theories about how the festival started.</em></strong><h1>

<h3><em>The first theory:</em> To celebrate the peaceful <em><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/coexistence">coexistence</a></em> of their people and the Aetas, the Malays colored their faces with soot to resemble and honor the indigenous population of the island. </h3>

<h3><em>The second theory:</em> After experiencing a bad harvest, the Malays went to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeta_people#:~:text=Aeta%20(Ayta%20%2F%CB%88a%C9%AAt,Luzon%20island%20in%20the%20Philippines."> Aetas</a></em> for help, and they shared their food and resources. According to this theory, the festival is a celebration of the generosity of the Aetas. </h3>

<h3 id="indent">Whichever theory is true, it’s clear that the festival began as a celebration of the kindness and generosity of the people of Panay Island. </h3><br>

	<br>
	Men and women dress up in intricate <em>costumes and masks resembling Roman soldiers and parade</em> through town, while others participate in passion plays depicting biblical scenes.<br>
	<br>
	The Moriones Festival is one of the <em>most anticipated events during Holy Week.</em> Witnessing the festival is also a great opportunity to explore the

	<br>
	Every year during Holy Week, the Moriones Festival is a lenten and religious celebration on the Philippine island of <em>Marinduque.</em> According to the locals, the "Moriones" are men and women dressed like biblical <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Roman_army">Imperial Roman soldiers,</a></em> complete with masks and costumes. Other street festivals in the Philippines that incorporate <em>cultural customs</em> have been spawned by the Moriones tradition.<br>
	<br>
	The term "Moriones" describes the group of disguised and masked penitents who spend seven days circling the <em>town in quest of Longinus.</em>
	From Holy Monday until Easter Sunday, morons prowl the town's streets, frightening children and attracting attention with their antics and surprises.
	At this folk-religious celebration, the life of <em>Saint Longinus,</em> a blind Roman centurion, is enacted. The celebration is distinguished by <em>vibrantly colored tunics, painted masks and helmets, and elaborate Roman costumes.</em> On the island of Marinduque, the municipalities of Boac, Gasan, Santa Cruz, Buenavista, and Mogpog combine to form one enormous stage. The observances are a component of Marinduque's Lenten festivities.<br>

		a datuship ritual, a wedding ceremony, a thanksgiving festival during harvest time, a peace pact, or all of these put together.
		An <em>important cultural occasion,</em> the Kaamulan Festival, is held in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaybalay">Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, Philippines.</a></em><br>
		<br>
		The province of <em>Bukidnon</em> was begun on <em>March 10, 1917,</em> which falls on the same day as the Kaamulan Festival. It honors the <em>history, growth, and identity of the province.</em> The seven
		indigenous tribes of Bukidnon province—the <em>Bukidnon, Higaonon, Talaandig, Manobo, Matigsalug, Tigwahanon, and Umayamnon—come</em> in tandem for the Kaamulan Festival. The festivities provides a stage for highlighting their <em>rich cultural history, customs, and way of life.</em> The festival’s aims are to protect and expand the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples">native tribes’</a></em> rich cultural diversity and traditions. It gives the tribes a chance to showcase their arts, music, <em>dances, and rituals</em> to visitors and the larger community.<br>
		<br>
		To liven up the fiesta celebration, a town official decided to invite some <em>indigenous people</em> to the area and forced them to do a few dance moves in <em><a href="https://pgaacreativedesign.com/projects/parks-open-spaces/pasig-rizal-plaza">Plaza Rizal.</a></em> On September 16, 1977, the Regional Development Council of Region 10 proclaimed that the Kaamulan festival was now the regional festival of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mindanao">Northern Mindanao</a></em> due to the huge popularity of the celebration and its national broadcast.<br>
		<br>
		Before being changed to the current date in 1996 to coincide with the province's foundation celebration, Kaamulan was held in the first week of September. However, in 2014, in <em>honor of Bukidnon's 100th founding anniversary,</em> it was shifted to the month of August. There was much <em>potential</em>
		for the festival to be listed among the Intangible <em><a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/">Cultural Heritage Lists of UNESCO.</a></em></h3></li><br>

Major activities include the MassKara Queen beauty pageant, carnivals, drum, bugle corps competitions, food festivals, sports events, musical concerts, agriculture-trade fairs, garden shows, and other special events organized every year.<br>
		<br>
		Originally, these <em><a href="https://blog.getcompass.ai/masskara-festival-messages/">masks</a></em> were created just to be sold to tourists and to generate income, and not for a festival that they were yet to conceptualize. The colorful masks created by the local residents were supposedly a signature <em>souvenir of the province</em> and to get the attention of foreign visitors.<br>
<br>
		<h2><strong><em> The MassKara has unique and exciting events that even first-time travelers can enjoy. To get the most out of the festivities, here are some tips for first-timers: </em></strong></h2>
		
<ul>
		<li id="wear"> Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. Lacson Street is the center of the festival and people have to walk a lot to enjoy the event.</li>
		<li id="wear">Bring an umbrella. Weather can be unpredictable and October can either be rainy or sunny. Make sure to check the Bacolod weather report too.</li>
		<li id="wear">Taste the iconic chicken inasal of Bacolod. From food stalls to restaurants, you can spot this chicken dish anywhere you go.</li>
		<li id="wear">Get the best view. Bacolod Public Plaza is the best area to watch the street performances as it is the venue for the dance arena.</li>
		<li id="wear"> Be ahead of time. Get on the streets an hour before the start of the festivity. The street dance typically starts at 2 in the afternoon so make sure that you are in a good spot. </li><br>
